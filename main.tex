\begin{abstract}
Assisting in foreign language learning is one of
the major areas in which natural language processing technology can contribute. For spoken language fluency assessment tasks, state-of-the-art deep learning models are trained based on large amount of data, which requires heavy human annotation work. However, there might exist inherent labeling bias from human annotators. In this work, we propose a novel framework which combines the tasks to jointly predict the labels which are annotated on both audio inputs and text inputs. Moreover, by jointly model the audio and text input data, we further improve the performance of language fluency assessments. From experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
